Since there are no MongoDB libraries for React, You need to run a Node.js server (API) that communicates information w/ React Native for database information. Download both branches and run the Node.js server first and then run React to access database feature. Use your own MongoDB Cluster ofcourse. Replace the DB_URI with your own MongoDB URI.
